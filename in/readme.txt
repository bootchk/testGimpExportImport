Files in this directory should not be deleted.
Each should be named sample.<format extension>.
The plugin uses these files to test image formats that do not have a save procedure.
The plugin automatically copies them into the test directory and renames them test.<format extension>

The files were gleaned from the net.
Should be public domain.

There should be a sample.psp (Paintshop Pro 6) file,
since Gimp has a load plugin,
but I can't find such a file on the net.
